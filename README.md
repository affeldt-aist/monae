This Coq library contains a hierarchy of monads with their laws used
in several examples of monadic equational reasoning.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Monadic effects and equational reasoning in Coq
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-monae
```

It installs two directories in `coq/user-contrib`: `monae` and
`monaeImpredicativeSet`.

To instead build and install manually (with GNU `make`), do:
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/affeldt-aist/monae.git
cd monae
make -j 4
make install
```

## Overview

This repository contains a formalization of monads including examples
of monadic equational reasoning and several models. This includes for
example the formalization of the following papers:
- [Gibbons and Hinze, Just do It: Simple Monadic Equational Reasoning, ICFP 2011] (except Sect. 10.2)
- [Gibbons, Unifying Theories of Programming with Monads, UTP 2012] (up to Sect. 7.2)
- [Mu, Equational Reasoning for Non-determinism Monad: A Case study of Spark Aggregation, TR-IIS-19-002, Academia Sinica]
- [Mu, Calculating a Backtracking Algorithm: An exercise in Monadic Program Derivation, TR-IIS-29-003, Academia Sinica]
- [Mu, Functional Pearls: Reasoning and Derivation of Monadic Programs, A case study of non-determinism and state, 2017]
  + This is a draft paper. In the first release, we formalized this draft up to Sect. 5.
    The contents have been since superseded by [mu2019tr2] and [mu2019tr3].
- [Mu and Chiang, Deriving Monadic Quicksort (Declarative Pearl), 2020]

This library has been applied to other formalizations:
- application to program semantics (see file `smallstep.v`)
- formalization of monad composition [Jones and Duponcheel, Composing Monads, Yale RR 1993] (Sections 2 and 3)
- formalization of monad transformers [Jaskelioff, Modular Monad Transformers, ESOP 2009] (up to Sect. 4)
  + completed with details from [Jaskelioff, Lifting of Operations in Modular Monadic Semantics, PhD 2009]
  + see directory `impredicative_set` for the formalization of [Jaskelioff, Modular Monad Transformers, ESOP 2009] (from Sect. 5)
- formalization of the geometrically convex monad (main reference:
  [Cheung, Distributive Interaction of Algebraic Effects, PhD Thesis, U. Oxford, 2017])

## About Installation with Windows 11

Installation of monae on Windows is less simple.
First install infotheo following the [instructions for Windows 11](https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo).
Once infotheo is installed (with opam), do:
- `opam install coq-monae` or `git clone git@github.com:affeldt-aist/monae.git; opam install .`

## Original License

Before version 0.2, monae was distributed under the terms of the `GPL-3.0-or-later` license

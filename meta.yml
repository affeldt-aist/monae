  ## Building and installation instructions

  The easiest way to install the latest released version of Monadic effects and equational reasoning in Coq
  is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):
  
  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  opam install coq-monae
  ```

  It installs two directories in `coq/user-contrib`: `monae` and
  `monaeImpredicativeSet`.

  To instead build and install manually (with GNU `make`), do:
  ``` shell
  git clone https://github.com/affeldt-aist/monae.git
  cd monae
  make -j 4
  make install
  ```

  ## Overview

  This repository contains a formalization of monads including examples
  of monadic equational reasoning and several models (in particular, a
  model for a monad that mixes non-deterministic choice and
  probabilistic choice). This corresponds to the formalization
  of the following papers:
  - [Gibbons and Hinze, Just do It: Simple Monadic Equational Reasoning, ICFP 2011] (except Sect. 10.2)
  - [Gibbons, Unifying Theories of Programming with Monads, UTP 2012] (up to Sect. 7.2)
  - [Mu, Equational Reasoning for Non-determinism Monad: A Case study of Spark Aggregation, TR-IIS-19-002, Academia Sinica]
  - [Mu, Calculating a Backtracking Algorithm: An exercise in Monadic Program Derivation, TR-IIS-29-003, Academia Sinica]
  - [Mu, Functional Pearls: Reasoning and Derivation of Monadic Programs, A case study of non-determinism and state, 2017]
    + This is a draft paper. In the first release, we formalized this draft up to Sect. 5.
      The contents have been since superseded by [mu2019tr2] and [mu2019tr3].
  - [Mu and Chiang, Deriving Monadic Quicksort (Declarative Pearl), 2020]

  This library has been applied to other formalizations:
  - application to program semantics (see file `smallstep.v`)
  - formalization of monad composition [Jones and Duponcheel, Composing Monads, Yale RR 1993] (Sections 2 and 3)
  - formalization of monad transformers [Jaskelioff, Modular Monad Transformers, ESOP 2009] (up to Sect. 4)
    + completed with details from [Jaskelioff, Lifting of Operations in Modular Monadic Semantics, PhD 2009]
    + see directory `impredicative_set` for the formalization of [Jaskelioff, Modular Monad Transformers, ESOP 2009] (from Sect. 5)
  - formalization of the geometrically convex monad (main reference:
    [Cheung, Distributive Interaction of Algebraic Effects, PhD Thesis, U. Oxford, 2017])

  ## About Installation with Windows 10 or 11
 
  Installation of monae on Windows is less simple.
  First install infotheo following the [instructions for Windows 10](https://github.com/affeldt-aist/infotheo).
  Once infotheo is installed (with opam), do:
  - `opam install coq-monae` or `git clone git@github.com:affeldt-aist/monae.git; opam install .`

  ## Original License

  Before version 0.2, monae was distributed under the terms of the `GPL-3.0-or-later` license

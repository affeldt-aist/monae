* Monadic equational reasoning in Coq

This repository contains a formalization of monads including several
models, examples of monadic equational reasoning, and an application
to program semantics.

** Requirements

- [[https://coq.inria.fr][Coq]] 8.9.0 or 8.9.1
- [[https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp][Mathematical Components library]] 1.8.0
- [[https://github.com/math-comp/analysis][MathComp-Analysis]] 0.2.0
  which requires
  + [[https://github.com/math-comp/bigenough/][bigenough]] first release
  + [[https://github.com/math-comp/finmap][finmap]] 1.2.0

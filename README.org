* Monadic equational reasoning in Coq

This repository contains a formalization of monads including several
models, examples of monadic equational reasoning, and an application
to program semantics.

- [Gibbons, Unifying Theories of Programming with Monads, UTP 2012] (up to Sect. 7.2)
- [Mu, Functional Pearls: Reasoning and Derivation of Monadic Programs, A case study of non-determinism and state, 2017] (up to Sect. 5)
- [Jones and Duponcheel, Composing Monads, Yale RR 1993] (Sections 2 and 3)
